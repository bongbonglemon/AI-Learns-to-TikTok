<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I was inspired by the recent TikTok trend. I figured since there are so many users on TikTok, 
it would be quite easy obtaining large amounts of dance video data. This along with my knowledge on pose estimation 
from doing Udacity's Intel Edge AI for IoT Developers Nanodegree and image captioning from doing Udacity's Computer Vision Nanodegree, I felt that this project would be accessible to me. 


### Built With

* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose)
